                <li>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients
                    (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with t
                    he wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.</li>

                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour
                    or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for
